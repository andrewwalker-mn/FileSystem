## Intermediate Submission
### Completed with
* fs_format
* fs_mount
* s_unmount
* fs_create
* Extra debug information
### Description of tests
We compared our fs behavior with the fs_solution behavior. We did this 
with different combinations of the fs_ commands mentioned above, using fs_debug
between each other command, including
* fs_format
* fs_mount
* fs_unmount
* fs_create
* fs_mount fs_format
* fs_format fs_mount
* fs_mount fs_unmount
* fs_format fs_mount fs_create fs_unmount

Additionally, we also used the cat command via the fs_solution on 
disk images generated by our fs to make sure they behaved as specified 
in the problem statement. This was done mainly for the provided images
to make sure fs_format was properly destroying old data on the disk. It was
additionally done to make sure fs_create behaved properly. 
**It would appear simplefs_solution begins indexing inodes at 1-- is this correct, and is this a convention we must keep?
